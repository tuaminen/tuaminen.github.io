# Roland RE-201 Space Echo Repair & Service

Issues:
-pots didn't work properly
-inputs were scratchy
-Echo was not heard

Done:
- changed power board power caps
- Cleanup


## Power caps
- C110, C108: 2x 1000uf 25V 
- C112, C113: 2x 1000uf 16V
- C111: 220uF 16V 
- C109, C106: 10uF 25V 
- C107: 1uF 50V 
- C105: 1uF 50V 

- C201: 100uF 50V  (from the Brushless motor circuit)

Small old caps were measured, they seemed good:
- 10uF: 11uF
- 10uF: 11uF
- 1uF 1.5uF
- 1uF: 1.3uF

- Power cap change didn't seem to change anything.

- Issue with the missing echo was that echo tape was put wrong way around.
