# SANDST0RM-1 Background

I wanted to try to build my own analog monosynth. 

I wanted it to be programmable via MIDI and store patches, so all synth controls had to be computer-controlled. For this I used digitally controlled potentiometers among other things.

For testing purposes I also decided to add an "manual override" mode (using jumpers) for manual control. For this reason, the synth is more or less a test platform than a proper "product".

Design was quite heavily based on Sequential Pro-1, but being computer-controlled.


# Features

- 1 x VCO (Curtis CEM3340-based)

- 1 x LFO (Curtis CEM3340-based)

- 1 x ADSR Envelope (Curtis CEM3310-based)

- VCF (Curtis CEM3320-based) 

- VCA (Curtis CEM3360)

- MIDI interface

- Roland PG-200 control interface! Idea was to add a possibility to use my PT-200 to control the synth parameters.




History:


# Version 1
v1.0 was built around 2/2022. It contained many bugs, which were fixed in v1.1.

Audio samples coming later.

# Version 1.1

Version 1.1. fixes most of the bugs in the design. However, it hasn't been built yet.
