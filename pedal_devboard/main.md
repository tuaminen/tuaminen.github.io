# Background

I am planning to create a series of unusual effect pedals. For this purpose I first wanted to create a development board, which would make it easier to create new designs.



## Version 1

Version 1.0 finished around 8/2023. This design was very rushed, and the PCB contained a crazy number of mistakes. 

The worst mistake ever was to place the input and output jacks wrong way around  (tips pointing toward the pedal edges).
